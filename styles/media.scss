/**
 * using this for splitting layouts can be overwhelming. Start mobile first
 * with every rule wrapped. Comment out the media query after you finished.
 * write the fixes for tablet, repeat for each query. At the end, extract
 * rules that are repeated. A: write mixins, B: place at the top out of the
 * query.
 *
 * Or complete a section, adjust for next query.
 *
 * I changed this idea. It was that I had mobile with a media query and was
 * going to define each layout. Rather, let media bleed into other styles.
